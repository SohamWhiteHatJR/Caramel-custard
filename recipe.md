In a large heavy saucepan, cook and stir 3/4 cup sugar over low heat until sugar is melted and golden. Pour into eight 6-oz. custard cups, tilting to coat bottom of cup; let stand for 10 minutes.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, vanilla and remaining sugar until blended but not foamy. Pour over caramelized sugar.

Place the cups in two 8-in. square baking pans. Pour very hot water in pans to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350Â° until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.

To unmold, run a knife around rim of cup and invert onto dessert place. Serve warm or chilled.
